# First-Run Onboarding — STATUS

Tracker for the FTUE program. Update on every merged PR. A phase is **done** only when code + host wiring (desktop **and** web) + tests + this file all agree.

## Scope (locked)

Hosted trial: **SHELVED** (deferred; if revived, gated on holding ≥50k $CPILOT — not an open no-key trial) · Safe{Wallet}+Sheets: **BUILD** · Placement: **faithful shared build in `packages/chat-surface`**.

## Decisions pending (block gated phases)

- [ ] ~~P5~~ (shelved): if revived — $CPILOT threshold (≥50k), on-chain holdings-check + caching, credit source, billing owner.
- [ ] P6-Safe: signing UX, tx simulation, chain/amount guardrails (principle: propose-only agent, human signs, per-call approval). **Design-pass security review = needs-changes across all 3 lenses (1 critical, 8 high, 12 medium) — see `phases/security-review-safe-*.md`; resolve before any P6 code.**
- [x] P2: `enable_local_models` enabled in the packaged supervisor (`service-env.ts`, merged). Preset = `Qwen/Qwen3-4B-GGUF` Q8_0 (4.28 GB, verified live). **OPEN (product copy):** the gate card shows the mock's verbatim "Qwen 3 4B · 5.6 GB" but no real quant is 5.6 GB — decide whether to keep the copy or show the real size (live progress already uses real `bytes_total`).

## Verify-at-impl

- [x] **P3 CSV blocker — RESOLVED** (`ftue/p3-csv-prereq` merged): both accept lists widened, `airdrop-claims.csv` fixture + both host resolvers shipped (17 tests). **New finding → P3-full:** a base64 `file` content-part is model-INVISIBLE (`runtime_worker/handlers/run.py:1151-1174` only summarizes name/size; only the TEXT adapter inlines rows), so the "Explain a CSV" chip must route CSV through the TEXT adapter (rows model-readable), not the file-first onboarding adapter. Baked into the P3-full brief.
- [ ] Finish catalog-driven model picker (`ModelPicker.tsx` hardcodes 3 models) so the gate/model popover is `/v1/agent/models`-driven.
- [ ] Server `truncated_display_address` not exposed as a profile field — chip truncates client-side.

## Design pass (workflow) — results & sequencing

Ran an 8-agent design workflow: one grounded implementation PRD per phase + a 3-lens adversarial Safe-signing security review + a completeness critic. Outputs in [`phases/`](./phases/).

- **PRDs delivered:** P0, P1, P2, P3, P6a, P6b (`phases/PRD-*.md`). **P4 PRD timed out** (broad agent hit the idle-timeout) → re-run narrower before the P4 build.
- **Sequencing (critic):** `P0 → P1 → (P2 ∥ P3) → P4 → (P6a ∥ P6b — serialized on ai-backend runtime files, gated) → P7`. P2's supervisor env edit (`RUNTIME_ENABLE_LOCAL_MODELS` in `service-env.ts`) is a hard pre-req that can land first.
- **Cross-cutting (own once):** one `onboarding.css` (P1 owns) + one token map; one canonical `FirstRunStore` port (P0) that P1–P3 import; one two-step run-create port (P2/P3 share); `SuggestionChips` + `WalletChip` are net-new shared components whose client-side address truncation lives IN the package (hosts can't share code). All onboarding I/O via host-injected ports (chat-surface eslint bans window/fetch/localStorage).
- **P4 is a real prerequisite, bigger than a chip:** the shipped `ToolPicker` has NO connector-install / 1-click / per-chat-scope / web-search-toggle plumbing — that UI is P4, and P6a/P6b's "1-click, zero new UI" claims depend on it.
- **ModelPicker owner:** `ModelPicker.tsx` hardcodes 3 Claude models; assign an owner (P3 / shared pre-req) to make the composer model list `/v1/agent/models`-driven, else the FTUE model popover shows the wrong models.
- **P0 hardening (open):** key the flag by the verified session's `claims.sub` derived in main (via `AuthService` async session load, not a sync cache read) instead of the renderer-supplied `workspaceId`. Current P0 keys by `workspaceId` (correct for single-user; per-account isolation is the hardening) — matches the "caller-supplied identity is untrusted" rule.
- **P6b ordering:** widen backend `Literal['read','draft']` (`desktop_routes.py:91`) to include `write` BEFORE the client sends the `write` scope, else Pydantic 422s.
