"""Production ``StageCommitConnector`` — the CallMcpTool seam outside the agent loop.

The :class:`CommitEngine` (``commit_engine.py``) is pure and fully fakeable; this
is the one place that touches a real external system in the v2 write path. It
replicates ``CallMcpTool.ainvoke``'s MCP dispatch seam
(``registry.resolve_server`` → ``resolution.provider.create_client`` →
``client.call_tool`` under ``asyncio.wait_for``) with the same typed-exception
mapping, but driven by an approved :class:`StageCommitRequest` from the worker
rather than a model tool call.

Fail-closed at every boundary: an unresolvable / disabled / unconfigured server,
a timeout, an auth/connection/client error, or a protocol-level ``isError`` all
raise a typed engine exception, which the engine maps to a ``FAILED`` /
``INDETERMINATE`` outcome — the handler then ledgers ``write.applied{failed}`` and
NOTHING sends twice. Connector output is untrusted: only a best-effort
``external_ref`` string is projected onto the result; the raw payload is never
echoed into a ledger event.

``read_remote_state`` returns ``None`` in D2 (a draft-send has no remote
precondition source — the handler's local draft-status precondition does the
work); the seam exists for D3 field-writes that read a record fingerprint.
